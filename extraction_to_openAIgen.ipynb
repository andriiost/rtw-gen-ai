Lifting and \\nmoving your harvest container many \\ntimes as you fill it adds to the work load. \\nAn alternative is to build a simple cart, \\nwhich allows you to sit and roll while you \\nharvest. This is less tiring for the knees, \\nback, hamstrings, and torso. The cart \\nalso holds your harvest container, so it \\nrolls along with you. \\nHow Does It Work? \\nThe cart straddles the crop bed or rows, \\nso that the wheels are on the paths \\nbetween the beds. A seat is mounted low to the \\nground, between the rear wheels, allowing you to \\nwork directly over the bed without stooping. The \\nseat swivels so you can harvest all parts of the \\nbed without twisting your body. A sternum pad \\nsupports your torso so you can lean forward and \\nease strain on your lower back. Move the cart for\\xad\\nward by pushing the rear wheels with your hands, \\nwheelchair fashion, or scoot along with your feet \\non the ground. Prop your harvest container on \\nthe front corner of the cart frame, within easy \\nreach. The front wheel swivels for easy steering. \\nBenefits of Using a Harvest Cart \\nLess fatigue and discomfort. Prolonged kneel\\xad\\ning to harvest, transplant, or weed puts small-\\nscale growers in one of the highest risk groups \\nfor occupational injuries. Harvesting from a seat\\xad\\ned position eliminates knee strain and is less tir\\xad\\ning for the back, hamstrings, and torso. Kneeling \\nrequires at least 25% more energy and stooping \\nrequires at least 45% more energy than sitting \\ndoes. \\nHarvest Speed and \\nPosture Analysis \\nWithout \\nCart \\nWith \\nCart \\nAvg. harvest speed \\n(mins/3lb crate) \\n7.8 \\n4.6 \\n% time spent in \\nunacceptable postures \\n46 \\n0 \\n% time spent in \\nmarginal postures \\n48 \\n93 \\n% time spent in \\nacceptable postures \\n6 \\n7 \\nThis data is based on a case study with the same \\nworker performing the same task. Postural analysis \\nwas compiled using the Ovaco Work Analysis System. \\nFaster. Using the cart lets you harvest the same \\namount of greens 40% more quickly. Faster har\\xad\\n15 \\n\\x0cHarvest Cart \\nvesting and quicker time to the cooler maintains \\nhigh crop quality. \\nLess soil compaction. Instead of kneeling or \\nwalking in the crop row or bed, the cart supports \\nyour weight. Your weight, plus the weight of the \\ncart, is transferred through the wheels to the \\npaths between the crops. \\nImproves profits. Cutting harvest time can save \\nlabor costs. A typical scenario might be that your \\nlabor costs are $7.00 per hour, and you harvest \\nfour days a week. If you save 30 minutes per har\\xad\\nvest day by using the cart, in 11-18 weeks the \\ncart will have paid for itself. If the harvest cart \\nprevents back or knee pain, you might also save \\nmoney on medical bills. \\nWhere Can I Get a Specialized \\nHarvest Cart? \\nThese carts, designed by Bob Meyer and Hal \\nBohne of the University of Wisconsin Agricultural \\nEngineering Lab, are not available in stores or \\ncatalogs. We can provide plans for you to make \\nyour own cart from readily available materials. \\nSome welding is required, \\nwhich can easily be done \\nby your local welder. \\nLocate a welding shop in \\nthe phone book under \\nwelding-custom fabri\\xad\\ncation. Buy the \\nparts at \\na hardware store or from a tool and equipment \\ncatalog such as: Northern Hydraulic, P.O. Box \\n1499, Burnsville, MN 55337. 800-533-5545. (This \\nreference is provided as a convenience for our \\nreaders. It is not an endorsement by the \\nUniversity of Wisconsin.) \\nHow Much Will it Cost? \\nThe parts for this cart cost about $150. Labor \\ncosts, custom welding, or welding shop rental \\ntimes will vary. \\nSteel: (1 1/4” square tubing, 1/8” wall \\nthickness. 3/32” flat stock for gussets \\nand supports) \\nSeat: (small tractor replacement) \\nRear Wheels: (26” pneumatic) \\nFront Wheel: (10” swivel caster) \\nSwivel: (boat seat) \\n$ 15 \\n$ 28 \\n$ 28/ea. \\n$ 36 \\n$ 15 \\nTotal \\n$150 \\nCart width should be 6”-12” wider than beds so \\nthat wheels will roll in the paths. Overall cart \\nlength is 42 1/2”. \\nContact Information \\nThis material was developed by the Healthy \\nFarmers, Healthy Profits Project, whose goal is to \\nfind and share work efficiency tips that maintain \\nfarmers’ health and safety and also increase prof\\xad\\nits.
