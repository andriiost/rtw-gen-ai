Although the work \\nof tradespeople and labourers can be physically demanding, there are opportunities to reduce those demands and the risk of injury  \\n. \\nBricklayer or Stonemason work can be very physical and heavy work with repeated lifting of bricks, stone and concrete \\ncinder blocks.  Accommodating labourers and tradespeople is possible even with the demands of these duties. \\n. \\n \\n \\n \\nBrick tongs allow lifting of a half \\ndozen bricks at a time with a \\nneutral wrist and power grip \\nposture. \\n \\n \\nThis lift can be placed on a wheeled platform that will move \\nalong the wall being built. It eliminates the lift of each cinder \\nblock from the bricklayer. \\n \\n \\nMixing mortar is often a barrier for labourers as \\n50lb bags must be lifted from ground level and \\npoured into the mixer at chest level. The \\nindustry is recommending moving to mortar silos \\nwhere pre-mixed mortar is delivered to a silo \\nplaced on-site and mortar is dispensed into a \\nwheelbarrow with no lifting of bags of mix. \\nThese are useful in new housing developments \\nwhere multiple houses are being built or \\ncommercial developments where large buildings \\nare being constructed. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nMortar stands are a great tool that raises the \\nmortar to ensure repeated bending is not \\nrequired. The base shown allows 2 different \\nheights but there are stands of varying heights. \\n \\n \\n \\nBricklayers and Stonemasons normally work from scaffolding and their work level changes as they \\nprogress.  This can mean lifting and shifting heavy planks from level to level as well as lifting \\nheavy sections of scaffold to assemble it. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThis model has a hand lever that cranks the plank up one notch at a time or lowers one notch at a \\ntime. This results in the bricklayer working at the optimum postures at all times, as they can make \\nincremental adjustments to the plank height with very little effort and time away from the work. \\nThese are purchased one frame at a time and a minimum of 2 are required but work platforms can \\nbe set-up the length of a house or one section at a time making this an affordable tool for \\nindependent operators. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n", "\\n \\n  \\nThe Accommodations SME\\u2019s are accepting referrals! \\n \\nACCOMMODATIONS NEWS \\nVolume 2/ Issue 16 (April 21, 2023) \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nDrywall Panel Lifters \\nDrywall lifters eliminate the need for lifting \\nand holding heavy sheets of drywall \\noverhead and allow one person to complete \\nthis task. \\n \\nConstruction \\u2013 Material lifters \\nThis week\\u2019s construction edition will focus on lifting/carrying heavy and awkward construction materials.
